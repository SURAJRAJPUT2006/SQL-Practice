## SELECT Queries Practice
Overview
-This folder contains SQL queries focused on the SELECT keyword applied to a simulated retail business dataset. The dataset models core retail operations including customer management, product catalog, and order processing.
-The goal is to practice foundational data retrieval and filtering operations commonly performed by data analysts within retail or e-commerce domains.

### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of three main tables with the following structures:
[Column-DescriptionFORREADME.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22166931/Column-DescriptionFORREADME.csv)
"Column","Description"
"customer_id","Unique identifier for each customer"
"customer_name","Full name of the customer"
"city","City where the customer resides"
"country","Country of the customer"
"email","Contact email of the customer"
"loyalty_points","Loyalty program points accumulated by customer"
"join_date","Date the customer joined the loyalty program"

[Uploading C"Column","Description"
"order_id","Unique order identifier"
"customer_id","Identifier of the customer who placed the order"
"order_date","Date when the order was placed"
"total_amount","Total dollar amount of the order"
"status","Status of the order (e.g., Completed, Pending)"olumn-DescriptionFORREADME2.csv…]()

"product_id","Unique product identifier"
"product_name","Name of the product"
"category","Product category (e.g., Electronics, Apparel)"
"price","Unit price of the product"
"stock","Number of units currently in stock"DescriptionFORREADME3.csv…]()


### Business Context
Retail analysts use these tables daily to answer critical business questions such as:

-Who are the most valuable and active customers?
-Which products are in demand or require restocking?
-How are sales performing this quarter?
-Which orders require follow-up or attention?

This exercise set enables practice for these real-world challenges, improving your SQL SELECT command expertise in a realistic setting.

### How to Use
-Load the provided CSV files (customers.csv, orders.csv, products.csv) into your SQL database environment as tables named customers, orders, and products.
-Open and review the SQL query files that contain practice problems using the SELECT statement.
-Run these queries against the dataset to observe results.
-Review inline comments in each query file explaining the logic and business relevance.
-Modify and experiment with queries to deepen understanding.
-Submit your query solutions for review and feedback.
