# Basic SQL Queries Practice

## Overview

- Practice foundational SQL queries on a simulated retail business dataset modeling customer management, product catalog, and order processing.
- Focus on mastering data retrieval and filtering using `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses with domain-specific business insight.

## Core Concepts

- Retrieve specific columns and rows from single tables.
- Use filtering with conditions (`=`, `>`, `<`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`).
- Select unique rows with `DISTINCT`.
- Sort results with `ORDER BY`.

## Business Use Cases

- Identify active/high-value customers.
- Determine product demand and restocking needs.
- Track sales performance quarterly.
- Prioritize orders needing attention.

## Instruction

- Load `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `products.csv` as tables.
- Review, run, and modify SQL scripts with embedded business logic comments.
- Practice writing clear, efficient queries.

# Intermediate SQL Queries Practice

## Overview

- Solve more complex problems involving data across multiple tables with real retail scenarios.
- Learn and apply JOINs, subqueries, aggregations, and conditional logic to extract deeper insights.

## Core Concepts

- Multi-table joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.).
- Subqueries, including correlated ones.
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering groups with `HAVING`.
- Use of CASE expressions for conditional logic.
- Data modification using DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Combining result sets with UNION and UNION ALL.

## Business Use Cases

- Calculate total sales per customer or product category.
