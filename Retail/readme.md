## SELECT Queries Practice
Overview
- This folder contains SQL queries focused on the SELECT keyword applied to a simulated retail business dataset. The dataset models core retail operations including customer management, product catalog, and order processing.

- The goal is to practice foundational data retrieval and filtering operations commonly performed by data analysts within retail or e-commerce domains.


### Business Context

Retail analysts use these tables daily to answer critical business questions such as:

- Who are the most valuable and active customers?

- Which products are in demand or require restocking?

- How are sales performing this quarter?

- Which orders require follow-up or attention?


This exercise set enables practice for these real-world challenges, improving your SQL SELECT command expertise in a realistic setting.

### How to Use
- Load the provided CSV files (customers.csv, orders.csv, products.csv) into your SQL database environment as tables named customers, orders, and products.

 - Open and review the SQL query files that contain practice problems using the SELECT statement.

- Run these queries against the dataset to observe results.

- Review inline comments in each query file explaining the logic and business relevance.

- Modify and experiment with queries to deepen understanding.

- Submit your query solutions for review and feedback.

### Expected Insights
- Upon running these queries, you will be able to:

 -Identify active and high-loyalty customers for targeted retention campaigns.

 -Filter and prioritize high-value orders for sales focus.

 -Extract product and order information essential for inventory management.

 -Gain hands-on practice with real-world SQL syntax for data retrieval and filtering.
